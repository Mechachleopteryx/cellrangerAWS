# ==== Config file for running the 10x Cell Ranger pipeline ====================


# Genome to use for alignment
GENOME:
    "tiny"

# Sample names for gene expression fastqs. If the same libraries were
# sequenced multiple times, just include all the fastq directories in the
# RAW_DATA list and make sure the fastqs from all runs begin with the
# sample name. If gene expression fastqs are not being processed, leave
# this blank.
RNA_SAMPLES:
    - "tinygex"

# Sample names for CITE-seq and cell hashing fastqs. If both methods were
# used, include both names separated by a comma. CITE-seq and cell hashing
# fastqs will be combined for each sample before running Cell Ranger. If 
# the libraries were sequenced multiple times, just make sure the fastqs 
# from all runs begin with the sample name. If CITE-seq or cell hashing 
# was not performed, leave this blank.
ADT_SAMPLES:


# List the TotalSeq catalog numbers for all antibodies used in the
# experiment. If CITE-seq or cell hashing was not performed, leave this
# blank.
ANTIBODIES:


# Sample names for VDJ fastqs. Follow the same parameters required for gene
# expression fastqs. If VDJ sequencing was not performed, leave this blank.
